"""``/api/collectibles``: slugs, mercer spheres and the rest, filtered as the tool filters.

Thin on purpose, and the thinness is the point: every refusal this endpoint makes is
``collect_view``'s -- unknown mode, retired group, and the one that matters, that
``mode=remaining`` needs the generated placement table and without it the honest answer is
a refusal rather than a shorter list. Duplicating any of that here would give the map and
the MCP tool two different opinions about the same question.

WARNING: the function name is the operation_id -- rename it and the committed schema
churns. FastAPI's default id is ``{function_name}_{path}_{method}`` and ``api-schema.d.ts``
is generated off it.
