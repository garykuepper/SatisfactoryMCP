"""``/api/events``: the SSE stream, driven through the handler rather than the client.

``importorskip`` at module scope, not a marker: ``fastapi`` lives in the optional
``web`` extra, so an install without it must skip this file rather than fail collection.

No ``client`` fixture here, and that is the point: this endpoint reads no world at all, so
what each test needs is an app whose watcher is pointed at an empty temporary directory --
the reader's real save root would make these tests about timing rather than about shape.
``test_watch.py`` covers the machinery underneath; this file covers what reaches the wire.
